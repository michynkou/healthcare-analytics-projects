# data-analytics-projects
 This repository showcases a collection of data analytics projects focused on healthcare quality, patient experience, and applied statistical analysis. Each project demonstrates end-to-end analytical workflows—including data cleaning, multi-table integration, exploratory analysis, visualization, and the use of Python, R, SQL, and NLP techniques to generate meaningful insights. Together, these projects highlight my ability to transform complex datasets into clear, actionable findings that support decision-making across clinical, operational, and organizational setting
